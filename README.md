# COMP6321 FALL 2023 Course Project
Machine Learning Project (Fall 2023) using pytorch
# Feature Extraction through CNN model-training and Transfer Learning for Classification using SVM, KNN and RF

This github repository is the Course Project Submission for Fall 2023 COMP 6321 â€“ Machine Learning course. 

In this project, we aim to investigate the impact of model selection and initialization methods on classification performance, evaluate feature extraction efficiency in pre-trained models, and assess their adaptability across different domains.

This project has been implemented in a series of two tasks. In task 1, we train a CNN model from scratch using random weight initialization on the Colorectal Cancer (CRC) dataset for the task of image classification. 

Task 2 builds on Task 1 using the encoder from the CNN model trained in Task 1 to extract features for Dataset 2 ( Prostate Cancer ) and Dataset 3 ( Animal Faces Dataset ). Finally, the extracted features are employed for classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. The process is repeated for a pre-trained PyTorch model to compare classification performance for features extracted from first model and the second one.

## Installation
Python version used for this project is 3.10.2 which can be downloaded and installed using the installer on https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/

You can install the needed python libraries using `pip`. Make sure to install specific versions for compatibility:

```bash
pip install pandas==2.0.3
pip install torch==2.0.0
pip install torchvision==0.15.1
pip install tqdm==4.66.1
pip install Pillow==9.5.0
pip install json==2.0.9
pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2
pip install numpy==1.23.5
pip install matplotlib==3.7.2
```
To run the code, you can use one of three options - 
### Option 1: Install Anaconda
Installing Anaconda allows to run all Jupyter Notebook files on local computer. If you haven't installed Anaconda, go here: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ This will install everything that you need.

### Option 2: Run on Google Colab
Running on Google Colab without local computer setup, which requires a Google Colab account. If you haven't register Colab, go here: https://colab.research.google.com/signup

### Option 3: Install jupyter notebook seperately on your system  
Jupyter notebbok can be installed independently from anaconda using the following cmd command -
>>> python -m pip install jupyter

To run the jupter notebook, open cmd and enter the following command - 
>>> jupyter notebook

# Task 1 Instructions

To run Task 1 Jupyter Notebook files, follow these steps:

1. Open each notebook in the Task1 folder.
2. Update the following variables in each notebook:

   a. `path`: Path to the folder where you downloaded the Colorectal Cancer dataset.
   b. `saveFilePath`: Path to save the hyperparameters (include the file name with extension).
   c. `saveModelPath`: Path to save the trained ResNet18 model.
   d. `imageInputChange`: Path of the file in the last code cell of each file (Cell titled "Model FLOPS").

   Note: Provide different paths for `saveFilePath` in each notebook to get different hyperparameter files.

3. Save the changes and run the notebooks.

# Task 2 Instructions

For Task 2, update variables in each Jupyter Notebook as follows:

1. In `Task2_FeatureExtraction_KNN` and `Task2_FeatureExtraction_SVM`:

   a. `path`: Point to the folder where you downloaded the Prostate Cancer Dataset in the 3rd code cell.
   b. `path1`: Point to the folder where you downloaded the Animal Face Dataset in the 17th code cell.
   c. `imageInput`: Point to an image file inside the Colorectal Cancer dataset.

2. In other Task 2 files:

   a. `pcancer_path`: Points to the folder where Prostate Cancer Dataset is downloaded.
   b. `ccancer_path`: Points to the folder where Colorectal Cancer Dataset is downloaded.
   c. `afaces_path`: Points to the folder where Animal Faces Dataset is downloaded.
   d. `imageInput`: Points to an image in the Colorectal Cancer dataset.

3. Inside Task 2 files, change the path for the variable `model1` to point to the path where you saved the models trained in Task 1.

4. Save the changes and run the notebooks.
