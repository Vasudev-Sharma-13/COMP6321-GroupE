# COMP6321 FALL 2023
Machine Learning Project (Fall 2023) using pytorch
# Project Title

This github repository is the Course Project Submission for Fall 2023 COMP 6321 – Machine Learning course. 

In this project, we aim to investigate the impact of model selection and initialization methods on classification performance, evaluate feature extraction efficiency in pre-trained models, and assess their adaptability across different domains.

This project has been implemented in a series of two tasks. In task 1, we train a CNN model from scratch using random weight initialization on the Colorectal Cancer (CRC) dataset for the task of image classification. 

Task 2 builds on Task 1 using the encoder from the CNN model trained in Task 1 to extract features for Dataset 2 ( Prostate Cancer ) and Dataset 3 ( Animal Faces Dataset ). Finally, the extracted features are employed for classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. The process is repeated for a pre-trained PyTorch model to compare classification performance for features extracted from first model and the second one.
